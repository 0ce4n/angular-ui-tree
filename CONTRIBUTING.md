# Contributing Guidelines

First of all, thank you for considering to contribute to the UI Tree project.
The community is important to us and we appreciate your time and effort to help pushing towards a better generic tree component.

As an attempt to make the process of contributing more pleasant for you and the reviewers, we've created a checklist.
Please make sure your PR confirms to critera listed below.

- Use a descriptive title using proper grammar (this is important because the same text will be used for the changelog)
- Make sure the build passes
- Do not include files from the `dist/` directory (These are created when a new release is made. Adding them to every PR will result in merge conflicts for other PR's.)

Our intention is to keep working on this document. Happy coding!
